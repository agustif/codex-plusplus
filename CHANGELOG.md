# Changelog

All notable changes to codex-plusplus are documented here.

This project uses semver for the installer, runtime, SDK, and published CLI package. Tweak authors should also use semver release tags so the manager can compare installed and available versions.

## 0.1.1

- Added a native Codex window bridge for main-scope tweaks.
- Tweaks can now create Codex-registered chat windows for routes such as `/local/<conversation-id>`, which enables split-screen chat tweaks to render the real Codex chat UI instead of transcript clones or unregistered BrowserViews.
- The installer now exposes Codex's internal window services to the Codex++ runtime during asar patching.

## 0.1.0

- Initial alpha release.
- One-command GitHub installer via `install.sh`; no npm package or `npx` dependency.
- Runtime-loaded local tweaks with Settings integration.
- App-update repair watcher for re-patching Codex after app updates, using the locally installed CLI.
- Codex++ release checks through GitHub Releases.
- Default tweak seeding from Bennett UI Improvements and Custom Keyboard Shortcuts GitHub release channels, with `--no-default-tweaks`.
- Review-only tweak update checks via required `githubRepo` manifest metadata.
- In-app tweak manager with enable/disable, config, release links, and maintenance actions.
